# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

  Besides React, of course, I used styled-components to write pure css style-sheet and keep the code clean and shorter.

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?
First, run npm install to locally install the dependencies used in this project, creating the node_modules folder 

Then, npm start will start the app

# General:

I would have worried about responsiveness

I am proud of the directory strucuture I followed and the layout of the main page.

I spent the most time with the bigger avatar(in the details screen) because I had to fetch another API.

I enjoyed coding the test, didn't have any issues I coudn't figure out quickly. I would suggest more details in the task.
